# EkvipCalculator
  Task for a job interview in the Ekvip d.o.o.

  # Overview

This specification outlines a C# console application that functions as a calculator. The calculator will accept a string containing a mathematical expression, parse and evaluate it, and print the result, but only for results up to the number 4. For results above 4, it should print “A Suffusion of Yellow” instead. It will support basic arithmetic operations. It also will accept the command “Red Button”, which returns a random Yijing hexagram.

 

# Features

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Modulo, Division.

Operators and Operands: It can be assumed that all operators and operands in the input string are separated by whitespace.

Parentheses: the expression can contain parenthesis.

Red Button: If the expression is “Red Button”, the program returns a random Yijing hexagram Unicode character.
